			<h2>Our Location</h2>
			<p>After a short period broadcasting from <a href="https://chcmadisoncountync.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHC/Reclaim Madison</a>, we are now and continuing to bring you local community radio from the campus of <a href="https://abtech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A-B Tech Madison</a>. Our former studio in the little red caboose was damaged severely in the floods from Helene, but we're still on the air.</p>
